<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `caresri` is to provide reusable and reproducible code for the [Stanford CARE summer research immersion program](https://med.stanford.edu/care/education/student-summer-internship).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `caresri` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("caresri")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/ShozenD/caresri) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ShozenD/caresri")
```

## Current Functionalities

-   `read_samadult`, `read_samadult_at`: Make reading NHIS sample adult files easier and reduce memory consumption.
-   `ggforest`: Create a forest plot to display logistic regression results.
