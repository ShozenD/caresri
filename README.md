The goal of `caresri` is to provide reusable and reproducible code for
the [Stanford CARE summer research immersion
program](https://med.stanford.edu/care/education/student-summer-internship).

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ShozenD/caresri) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ShozenD/caresri")
```

## Current Functionalities

-   `read_samadult`, `read_samadult_at`: Make reading NHIS sample adult
    files easier and reduce memory consumption.
-   `ggforest`: Create a forest plot to display logistic regression
    results.
